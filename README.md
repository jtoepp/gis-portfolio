**Figure 3:** A map depicting Prentiss County, MS, US with contour lines for the elevation in meters in addition to slope classified by color with red being highest and blue being lowest. Lastly, there is a hillshade with a sun angle of 315Â° to make the elevation stand out more.

**Figure 7:** A map depicting proposed construction paths for a new road based on a custom SAW model. The two methods that were calculated were to prioritize the cheapest road cost vs. the highest aesthetic value while minimizing distance.

**Figure 8:** A map depicting the optimal school location and least cost to construct a new road from the selected destination to the proposed school location. A modifed SAW model was used as in Figure 7 above, with the added consideration of the calculated best site for the school.
